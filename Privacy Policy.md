**General Principles**  

**Applicable Law:** This joint - copyright arrangement is subject to the laws applicable to Artificial Intelligence - Generated Content (AIGC) in the relevant jurisdiction.

This multi - party collaborative creation process gives rise to the joint copyright.

**Rights and Obligations of Joint Owners**
