Privacy Policy for Text Tuner – AI Sidebar Chrome Extension
Last Updated: June 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Text Tuner – AI Sidebar ("Text Tuner," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Chrome extension.

Text Tuner is designed to help you read faster and write better by providing AI-powered summarization and text correction functionalities directly in your browser. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

1. Information We Do NOT Collect or Store

We want to be crystal clear:

No Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Text Tuner does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, IP address, or Browse history) from your use of the extension.
No User Account Data: Text Tuner does not require you to create an account, and therefore, we do not collect any account-related information.
No Browse Data: We do not track your Browse habits, visited websites, or search queries.
2. Information We Process

When you use Text Tuner's features, certain data is processed to provide the service:

User Input (Text for Processing):
When you use the "summarize" feature, the text content of the webpage or selected text is sent to our AI service provider.
When you use the "text corrector" feature, the text you type or select for correction is sent to our AI service provider.
Crucially: This text content is sent directly from your browser to the AI service provider (powered by the free Gemini API) for processing. Text Tuner itself does not store or retain this content on our servers. It is processed in real-time to generate your summary or corrected text and then discarded by our system after the request is fulfilled.
3. How We Use the Information We Process

The text content you provide is used solely for the purpose of fulfilling your explicit requests:

To generate summaries of webpages or selected text.
To correct grammar, spelling, and style of your written text.
To rewrite text according to your chosen tone.
4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

Third-Party AI Service (Gemini API): To provide the AI functionalities (summarization, text correction), Text Tuner sends the text you input or the content of the webpage you are summarizing to the Gemini API, a service provided by Google. Your data handling by Google is governed by Google's privacy policies. Text Tuner explicitly does not store this content.
No Sale of Data: We do not sell, rent, or trade any user data to third parties.
Legal Compliance: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect and defend our rights or property, or ensure the safety of our users or the public.
5. Data Security

While Text Tuner does not store your content, we are committed to ensuring that data transmitted to the Gemini API is handled securely. All communication between your browser and the Gemini API is encrypted using industry-standard protocols (HTTPS) to protect the data during transit.

6. Data Retention

As Text Tuner does not store your text input or any other personal data, there is no data to retain. The data sent to the Gemini API for processing is transient and not stored by our extension after your request is processed.

7. Children's Privacy

Text Tuner is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete such information from our records.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
